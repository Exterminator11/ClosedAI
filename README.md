## About the Project
LLMs (Large Language Models) have been released by various entities and research organizations for academic and commercial use. These models can be used for generating human-like responses in text-based systems with a server-client model. 

## Objectives
- AI/ML-based Text Summarization of given text.
- Summarization of Science and Technology (S&T) related documents.
- Summarization of NEWS papers headlines and editorial pages for a quick overview of specific topics.
- Reformatting and grammar checks with contextual integrity.
- Additional capabilities that the developer can incorporate based on features available in open-source LLM models.

The solutions will be graded on the following criteria:
- Capabilities
- Ease of use
- Flexibility and scalability of deployment
- Number of compatible models
